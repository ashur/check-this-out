FUTURE ASHUR

the current problem is that adding `filter` to

```
transition-property: opacity, filter;
```

is triggering `frametransitionend`. This would be fine, but it's causing a *second* invocation of `framerun` even though that's already been called because we're not detecting the transition

details are still fuzzy, but this is throwing everything off

- maybe add a new .willTransition property to frames?
