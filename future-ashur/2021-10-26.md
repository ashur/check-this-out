FUTURE ASHUR

- You're considering an approach where there aren't "top" and "bottom" screens
- Instead, the visible screen is always on top by z-index:

1. "top" opacity: 1 (make it appear)
2. "bottom" opacity: 0, background: "" (hide, force browser to lose original image)
3. "bottom" background: <next image>
4. "top" z-index: 0, "bottom" z-index: 1 (swap screens)
5. "bottom" opacity: 1 (make it appear)

counterpoint!

maybe doing the `background: ""; â†’ background: "..."` shuffle alone will take care
of the flash...???

(It did! Refactor avoided! ðŸ’«)

## Also!!!

- [x] You might be able to back out the business of showing/hiding the bottom screen in `FrameWrangler.hideTopScreen` and `FrameWrangler.showTopScreen`
	- This may help Gideon's demo be less flashy?
- [x] Minify the Messages screen, possible FCP gain
- [ ] Crop screensâ€¦?
